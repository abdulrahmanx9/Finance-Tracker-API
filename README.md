# Finance-Tracker-API

A backend API built with Django for managing personal finances, including budgets and transactions.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Budget Management:** Create, read, update, and delete budgets.
*   **Transaction Tracking:** Record income and expenses with detailed information.
*   **User Authentication (Future):** Secure user accounts for personalized finance tracking (planned feature).
*   **RESTful API:**  Designed with a RESTful architecture for easy integration with front-end applications.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Python 3.8+:** The project is built with Python 3.
*   **Django 5.0+:** A high-level Python web framework.
*   **pip:** Python package installer.
*   **Virtualenv (Recommended):**  For creating isolated Python environments.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdulrahmanx9/Finance-Tracker-API.git
    cd Finance-Tracker-API
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Create requirements.txt first, see below
    ```

    To create `requirements.txt`, you can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing django.  However, given the provided file structure, the required dependencies are only Django. To do this:

    ```bash
    pip install Django
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply Migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

While detailed API documentation is under development, here's a basic example:

*   **Retrieve all budgets (example):**

    `GET /budgets/`  (Needs implementation in `urls.py` and `views.py`).

    Example using `curl`:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/budgets/
    ```
    (Assumes a `Budget` model and corresponding views and URLs are defined.)

**API Endpoints (To be Implemented):**

| Endpoint            | Method | Description                            |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/budgets/`         | GET    | List all budgets                       |
| `/budgets/`         | POST   | Create a new budget                    |
| `/budgets/{id}/`    | GET    | Retrieve a specific budget by ID        |
| `/budgets/{id}/`    | PUT    | Update a specific budget               |
| `/budgets/{id}/`    | DELETE | Delete a specific budget               |
| `/transactions/`    | GET    | List all transactions                  |
| `/transactions/`    | POST   | Create a new transaction               |
| `/transactions/{id}/` | GET    | Retrieve a specific transaction by ID |
| `/transactions/{id}/` | PUT    | Update a specific transaction          |
| `/transactions/{id}/` | DELETE | Delete a specific transaction          |

*Note: The API endpoints provided are a suggestion based on RESTful principles and require implementation in the Django project.*

## Configuration Options

The project settings are configured in `app/app/settings.py`.  You can modify settings such as:

*   `SECRET_KEY`:  Important for security, especially in production.  **Change this!**
*   `DEBUG`: Set to `True` during development and `False` in production.
*   `ALLOWED_HOSTS`:  Configure allowed hostnames for deployment.
*   `DATABASES`: Configure the database connection settings.  By default, it uses SQLite.

**Environment Variables:**

Consider using environment variables for sensitive information like `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials, especially for deployment.  Libraries like `python-dotenv` can help manage environment variables.
